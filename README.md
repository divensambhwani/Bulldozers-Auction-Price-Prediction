   - Feature generation on date variable
   - Categorical variables mapping
   - Fixing missing values
   - Numericalize features
- Created the base model
- Hyper-paramter tuning:
  - n_estimators
  - min_samples_leaf
  - max_features
- Model Interpretation
  - Feature importance
  - Cluster analysis
  - Partial dependence
  - Extrapolation
  - Tree interpreter
